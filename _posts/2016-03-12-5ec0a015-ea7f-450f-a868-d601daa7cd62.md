## Loofahs with Labels?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/db1a870b-c78b-46d8-be95-009dd4c9a476.jpg)

## It's time to shower with personality. With Sudsy Buddies, you'll not only know which loofah is yours in the shower, but you'll give yourself another way to express yourself.

## Start your day off with some extra motivation with our "Rockstar" poof; remind yourself to let it go with our "Whatever" loofah; grow with pride as you see your "Mommy" loofah right next to your "Little Princess" poof or our vibrantly green Sudsy for your "Lil' Man"; or laugh with our Darth Vadorish "Who's Your Daddy?" loofah for the man who doesn't want a bright pink poof to wash with.

## That's what's great about Sudsy Buddies, and that's why we love what we do. Our mission is to give smiles and help bring joy, one shower at a time. We're much more than a shower poof.
